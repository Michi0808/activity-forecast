2. **Successfully Retrieved Weather Information Using OpenWeatherAPI:**

   - Integrated OpenWeatherAPI with Retool to fetch weather data based on the received `city`.
   - Retrieved weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed using `query1`.

3. **Successfully Sent Weather Information via Email:**

   - The email included clear data on current weather conditions, including temperature and wind speed.

4. **Generated Ideal Weather Conditions and Activity Recommendations Using Retool AI:**

   - Successfully tailored activity suggestions based on the current weather.
