## Completed Tasks:

1. **Set Node Setup in n8n:**

   - Configured a Set Node to define the `city` as "Tokyo" and the `activity` as "Hiking".
   - Successfully tested the node to ensure proper data output.

2. **Retool Resource Creation:**
   - Attempted to create a Webhook resource in Retool but found it unavailable.
   - Decided to proceed with creating a `REST API` resource as an alternative.
   - Successfully configured the `REST API` resource as a placeholder for Webhook functionality.
